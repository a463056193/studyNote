* 句子由词组成，词的数量是任意的。例如：

  ​	He left us.

  ​	The man in the corner lowered his newspaper.

  ​	Whenever I see Tammy I worry about how I look.

  ​	Until tomorrow then.

   改变句子的词序，就会形成新的句子。

  ​	I can help you.

  ​	Can I help you.

* 语法解释如何组词造句。句中的词由于用法的不同，分为若干类，称为词类。

  所有句子开头第一个字母必须大写，末尾以句号、问号或感叹号结束。

* 语句由一定的成分组成，如动词verb、动词的主语subject以及宾语object等

​		一个句子可以包含一个或多个语句clause

​		I can help you if you will let me.

​		Whenever you need to talk to someone, just pop in and see if I'm here.

​		许多句子经常仅由一个语句构成，这样的句子叫做简单句

​		He arrived on Friday.

​		语句离不开动词

​		当然句子不一定总是以语句的形式出现

​		Certainly not.

​		Until tomorrow then.

* 短语是可以自然搭配在一起的一组词

  the other day

  my friend Henry

  in spite of

  over the hill

  would have been walking

  有些词可以用来指一个或多个人或事务，用单数singular和复苏plural来区分。一个较为概括的术语就是数number。代词和名次有单数和复数形式。

  在语法上表明说话者或被谈及者时，用第一人称first person指代说话者，用第二人称second person 指代听者，用第三人称third person 指代被谈及者。人称代词也有单复数之分，如第一人称复数first person plural、第三人称单数 third person singular

* 动词是表示动作或状态的词。普通动词又叫作主动词main verb

  come go think want economize believe

  主动词有时又叫作行为动词doing word。有一组特殊的动词叫作主动词。助动词与主动词连用构成不同的时态。

  I am thinking.

  She has seen the film already.

  I can help you.

  We might need to

* 表示事物或抽象概念的名称的词叫作名词noun。名词有时又叫作命名词

  table book ugliness time animal thing

* 如果不想在句中或段落中重复使用同一名词，可用代词替代，代词就是代替名词或名词短语的词

  Gary saw Sue so he asked her to help him.

  Ross was hungry so he stopped at a burger bar.

* 形容词adjective提供了与名词相关的更多信息，常用于描写或突出该名词。形容词又叫作描写词

  a man

  a tall man

* 限定词determiner用于修饰所谈及的人、事物或概念。限定词包括定冠词definite article、不定冠词 indefinite article以及及物主限定词possessive

  the cat	a man	my aunt	their TV

* 副词adverb用于说明行为发生的方式、时间或地点

  He lifted the box carefully.

  某些副词也可用在形容词前

  He was a rather tall man.

  This cake is quite nice.

  It was fairly good.

  It's a very hot day.

  副词还可用于引出一个句子。许多副词由形容词加词尾 -ly 构成

  Fortunately, the rain stayed away.

  Honestly, I can't help it.

* 介词preposition可与名词或动词搭配使用，介词通常用来描述事物的运动方向或所处的位置

  on the bridge	over the rooftops	in the morning	at the gates

  介词用在名词之前构成介词短语，其作用相当于一个副词

  He is coming now.

  He in coming in the morning.

  I found him there.

  I found him near the gates.

* 连词conjunction可将两个以及两个以上的名词或句子连接在一起。连词有时也叫作连接词joining word

  I went to the shop and bought some bread.

  I bought some bread, but I forgot to get the milk.

* 有些词可以有多种词性，比如在一个句子中做名词，但在另一个句子中也许做动词

  Christopher and angus play golf together on Fridays.
