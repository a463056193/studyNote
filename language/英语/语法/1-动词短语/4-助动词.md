助动词通常与主动词连用，表示动作的时间和持续性

* be 和 have 是基本助动词（primary auxiliary）。基本助动词用于构成复合时态

* be 可用于构成现在进行时态和过去进行时态

  I **am working**.

  Rob **is using** the computer.

  We **were** all **wondering** about that.

  Kevin **was teaching** in America in 1985.

  be 还可用于被动语态

* have 可用于构成现在完成时态和过去完成时态

  Stephen **has finished** fixing the car.

  George and Alice **have seen** the show already.

  Amanda **had already** eaten when we arrived.

  They **had** not **expected** to see us there.

* do 是辅助助动词（supporting auxiliary）。可用于构成否定句，疑问句以及加强陈述句的语气

  I do not like sausages at all.

  Do you like prawns?

  You do like prawns, don't you?

* will，may，might以及其他的一些的动词是情态助动词（modal auxiliary verb），它们通常被简称为情态动词（modal verb），所表示的情态有 愿望、义务、必要、可能等

  Charlie will go home on Friday.

  Charlie may go home on Friday.

  Charlie could go home on Friday.

  Charlie must go home on Friday.

* 几个不同的助动词可在动词短语中组合使用。比如，动词短语可由情态助动词 + have + be + 主动词构成

  I could have been making a bad mistake by trusting hime.

  Sara will have been living in New Zealand for 2 years next month.

  You must have been given the wrong number.

  一个以上的助动词连用时，第一个助动词通常有以下语法功能

  * 表示时态，并且是动词短语的限定部分

    I have seen it.

    She had seen it.

    She has been thinking.

  * 体现与主语在人称和数上的一致

    She has seen it.

    They have seen it.

    I am looking for it.

    You are looking for it.

  * 在其之后加否定词表示否定

  * 用在主语前表示提问
  
* 助动词的简略式

  am not 在问句中的简略式为aren't I

* 简略式不如完整形式正式，因此简略式在口语中更常用些。完整形式通常用于正式的书面语中

* 助动词也可用来代替动词短语，以免重复

  * 肯定句中采用肯定替代，与so或too连用

    I went to the park and Lucy **did too**.

    I loved the film, and **so did** Finlay.

  * 否定句中采用否定替代，与neither或nor

    My dad never eats mussels and **neither do** I.

    I don't want to speak to William now. **Nor do** I.

    I can't understand it. **Neither can** I.
    
  * 助动词用于肯定句中可以表示强调。助动词用于表示强调时，不能用简略式
  
    You **have** made a mess!
  
    That **was** a nice surprise!
  
    I **am** proud of Katie. She's so clever.
  
    在现在一般时和过去一般时中，do的不同形式可用于表示强调。
  
    I do like Penny. So **do** I.
  
    We **did** have a lovely time.
  
  * 助动词可用于简略回答问题。答语中的助动词要与疑问句中的助动词保持一致。这样可以避免重复问句中的主动词。简略答语在口语中十分普遍。
  
* be

  be既可以作助动词，也可用作主动词

* be是不规则动词，有八种形式： be, am, is, are, was, were, being, been

  * be的现在一般时和过去一般时较其他动词有更多的变化形式

    I am late.	We are late.

    You are late.	He is late.	They are late.

    I was late.	We were late.

    You were late.	You were late.

    She was late.	They were late.

    He is being very helpful these days.

  * be的过去分词是been

    We have been ready for an hour.
